Recruiting high school baseball players from all over the country can be a challenging task for college baseball coaches. The hope with this app is it aids college baseball coaches in their recruiting process. 
Coaches want the best possible players on their 35 man rosters and this app can help them achieve them that because it provides accessibility during their recruiting trips. 
It also provides them a way to separate their personal contacts from their recruiting contacts. Everything that a coach needs during recruiting is found in this app.

I chose recruiting for college baseball as a theme because as a college baseball player here at Tech, I am very passionate and knowledgeable about the process. 
I was able to get a lot of valuable input from my coaches on the functions they hoped to be able to have in this app.
